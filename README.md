# dallevision-client
DalleVision-client is a React web page that interacts with DalleVision-server, allowing one to view the content as it's being generated in realtime.

Further updates will include better event/error logging, a user authentication system (as opposed to using cookies, a temporary solution for tracking upvotes on images), the ability to downvote, and better presentation of the UI/UX for mobile devices.
